## Installation

Themer works with Rails 5 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby
gem 'themer'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install themer

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'themer', github: 'jonhue/themer'
```

Now run the generator:

    $ rails g themer

---

## Usage

To setup Themer, use the `themify_class` helper method to specify the current theme in your views `html` tag:

```erb
<html class="<%= themify_class %>">
```

Then create a `current_theme` helper method in your `ApplicationHelper` (`app/helpers/application_helper.rb`):

```ruby
def current_theme
    themer current_user.theme
end
```

**Note:** This helper method is not required but helpful when you want to store information about selected themes in your database.

Lastly, add the following to your `application.sass` file (`app/assets/stylesheets/application.sass`):

```sass
@import "themer/default"
@import "themer"
```

### Stylesheets

To get started define your colors in the `'default'` theme (`app/assets/stylesheets/themer/default.sass`):

```scss
$themer--default: (
    text: (
        dark: #000000,
        base: #eeeeee
    ),
    background: #ffffff
);
```

In your Sass stylesheets you are able to use the `color` function to access your theme colors:

```sass
html
    background: color(background)
p
    color: color(text, base)
```

**Note:** If you need to get a HEX value for a specific color pass `true` as a third attribute to the color function. This will return the color for the theme set as default.

### Methods

Themer adds a couple of helpful methods to your controllers and views:

```ruby
# Returns the currently used theme. Passed parameter overrides theme stored in cookies and default theme.
themer current_user.theme

# Set the theme
set_themer 'default'

# Check if a theme is available
themer_available? 'default'

# Return Themer class for `html` tag
themer_class
```

### Switching themes automatically

You can [configure](#configuration) Themer to update the theme based on day and nighttime.

To automatically select a theme just set the theme to `'auto'`:

```ruby
set_themer 'auto'
```

---

## Configuration

You can configure Themer by passing a block to `configure`. This can be done in `config/initializers/themer.rb`:

```ruby
Themer.configure do |config|
    config.themes = ['default']
end
```

* `themes` Array of available themes. Takes an array of strings. Defaults to `['default']`.
* `default` Default theme. Takes a string. Defaults to `'default'`.
* `auto` Enable automatic themes. Takes a boolean. Defaults to `false`.
* `day` Day theme. Takes a string. Defaults to `'light'`.
